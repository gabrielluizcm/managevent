# ManagEvent

**ManagEvent** aims to be a place to events management *(as the name suggests)* and invitations, and be a centered place for information and discussions about them. Made as a study project for NodeJS classes

In the app you'll be able to **create events** with their details and **send invitations over email** to desired guests, who will then be able to **confirm presence or reject your invitation** through the received link. Guests (and hosts alike) will also be able to **create posts and discussions** with questions and comments on the events page, something like a forum, where other guests and event staff will be able to share information.

## MVP
**ManagEvent's** first versions will support text content only, with no *forum-like* feature, just the confirmation for guests. Further updates will make it possible to post images on discussions and events pages and other QoL updates, as embed [Maps](https://www.google.com.br/maps/preview) to make easier to find presencial events.

## Early Access
Early stages will allow **only invited users** to create events, but with the *forums update* anyone will be able to sign-up and start organizing their own events.
